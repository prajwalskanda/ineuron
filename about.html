    <h3 class="hoot">Hosting various types of events is a regular business practice for many organizations. Event management can be challenging as it requires a range of skills and specialized knowledge. Learning about how event management works can help organizations
        to devote proper efforts and resources to it. In this article, we discuss event management and the skills you'll need to be successful in the role. Event management is the process of planning and hosting a variety of public and private events
        for social or business purposes. They may be large-scale or small-scale events and can include business conventions, training seminars, industry conferences, trade shows, ceremonies, parties, concerts, festivals and press conferences. Event managers
        must follow the clients' instructions and work within a specified budget and predetermined schedule. To set up the events, they must collaborate with various vendors. The difference between event management and event planning is that while event
        planning concerns itself with coming up with workable event ideas and the activities that will take place during the events, event management leans more towards project management and deals with the organization and execution of the event plans.
        However, the roles do overlap often, and event managers may be involved with the creative planning aspects of the events as well. For established and new companies, event management can be an essential aspect of their marketing strategy. Organizing
        small-scale or large-scale events can help promote a brand and further a business's interests. Events create opportunities for people who attend these events to learn about the hosting organization's products and services and may even convert
        attendees into loyal customers. Additionally, along with making their brands better known, the events that the companies organize can provide marketing education and training to their employees. They can foster team-building exercises, improve
        relations between different departments, and boost networking across industries. The events may also celebrate business milestones and raise money for various causes.</h3>
